A simple web application that helps users calculate **shipping costs** and estimate **delivery times** based on package weight and distance.

---

## 🧩 Features
- Calculate shipping cost in real time
- Display estimated delivery days
- Clean and responsive interface
- Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**

## 🧮 Formula Used
> **Total Cost = Base Charge + (Weight × Distance × Rate Per Km)**  
> Base charge = ₹50  
> Rate per km per kg = ₹0.05  

Estimated delivery days = `distance / 500`

## 🧠 Example
If a package weighs **5 kg** and travels **1000 km**,  
Total = 50 + (5 × 1000 × 0.05) = ₹300  
Delivery = 2 days (approx.)
